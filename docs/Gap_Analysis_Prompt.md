**PROJECT CODEBASE AUDIT & ANALYSIS**

Perform a comprehensive, end-to-end audit of the project's entire codebase with the following objectives:

**IDENTIFICATION SCOPE:**
Identify and document all instances of:

- Incomplete or partially implemented features
- Code patches and temporary fixes
- Technical debt and architectural misalignments
- Gaps between intended design and actual implementation
- Inconsistencies in coding patterns and standards
- Hidden issues or "imposters" (code that appears functional but has underlying problems)

**ANALYSIS REQUIREMENTS:**

- Examine the full development history to understand the current state
- Assess how past decisions have impacted the present codebase
- Evaluate the alignment between project goals and current implementation

**REPORT FORMAT:**

Structure your findings as follows:

**For each identified issue, provide:**

1. **Issue Title** - Clear, descriptive heading
2. **Current State** - What exists now and why it's problematic
3. **Root Cause** - What led to this situation
4. **Impact** - How this affects the project (severity: Critical/High/Medium/Low)
5. **Required Action** - Specific, actionable steps to resolve
6. **Implementation Instructions** - Detailed how-to guidance for the fix
7. **Success Criteria** - What "done" looks like
8. **Goal Alignment** - How fixing this supports overall project objectives

**PRIORITIZATION:**
Organize findings by priority (Critical → High → Medium → Low) to enable focused, sequential remediation.

**DELIVERABLE EXPECTATIONS:**

- Be exhaustive but avoid redundancy
- Use precise technical language
- Provide concrete examples where applicable
- Ensure each point is actionable and self-contained
- Include estimated effort where relevant

**ULTIMATE GOAL:**
Establish a clean, maintainable codebase foundation that enables confident, efficient
